    "## Defining Functions\n",
    "Example of a function definition:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def cylinder_volume(height, radius):\n",
    "    pi = 3.14159\n",
    "    return height * pi * radius ** 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "After defining the cylinder_volume function, we can call the function like this.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cylinder_volume(10, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is called a function call statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function definition includes several important parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Header\n",
    "Let's start with the function header, which is the first line of a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function header always starts with the def keyword, which indicates that this is a function definition.\n",
    "Then comes the function name (here, cylinder_volume), which follows the same naming conventions as variables. You can revisit the naming conventions below.\n",
    "Immediately after the name are parentheses that may include arguments separated by commas (here, height and radius). Arguments, or parameters, are values that are passed in as inputs when the function is called, and are used in the function body. If a function doesn't take arguments, these parentheses are left empty.\n",
    "The header always end with a colon :.\n",
    "Function Body\n",
    "The rest of the function is contained in the body, which is where the function does its work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of a function is the code indented after the header line. Here, it's the two lines that define pi and return the volume.\n",
    "Within this body, we can refer to the argument variables and define new variables, which can only be used within these indented lines.\n",
    "The body will often include a return statement, which is used to send back an output value from the function to the statement that called the function. A return statement consists of the return keyword followed by an expression that is evaluated to get the output value for the function. If there is no return statement, the function simply returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming Conventions for Functions\n",
    "Function names follow the same naming conventions as variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your function names. They can’t have spaces, and need to start with a letter or underscore.\n",
    "You can’t use reserved words or built-in identifiers that have important purposes in Python, which you’ll learn about throughout this course. A list of Python reserved words is described [here](https://docs.python.org/2.5/ref/keywords.html).\n",
    "Try to use descriptive names that can help readers understand what the function does."

    "```\n",
    "In the example above and the example below, word is said to have scope that is only local to each function. This means you can use the same name for different variables that are used in different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## This works fine\n",
    "def some_function():\n",
    "    word = \"hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def another_function():\n",
    "    word = \"goodbye\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Variables defined outside functions, as in the example below, can still be accessed within a function. Here, word is said to have a global scope.\n",

    "## This works fine\n",
    "word = \"hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def some_function():\n",
    "    print(word)\n",
    "\n",
    "some_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we can still access the value of the global variable word within this function. However, the value of a global variable can not be modified inside the function. If you want to modify that variable's value inside this function, it should be passed in as an argument. You'll see more on this in the next quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope is essential to understanding how information is passed throughout programs in Python and really any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "More on Variable Scope\n",
    "When you program, you'll often find that similar ideas come up again and again. You'll use variables for things like counting, iterating and accumulating values to return. In order to write readable code, you'll find yourself wanting to use similar names for similar ideas. As soon as you put multiple piece of code together (for instance, multiple functions or function calls in a single script) you might find that you want to use the same name for two separate concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, you don't need to come up with new names endlessly. Reusing names for objects is OK as long as you keep them in separate scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good practice: It is best to define variables in the smallest scope they will be needed in. While functions can refer to variables defined in a larger scope, this is very rarely a good idea since you may not know what variables you have defined if your program has a lot of variables."
