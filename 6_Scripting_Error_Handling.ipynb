    "1. Prepare to Use Command Line\n",
    "To install Python and follow this lesson, you will need to use the command line. We will walk you through all the details, so don't worry if you have never used it before! If you would like to learn or refresh on command lines, we strongly recommend going through this free Shell Workshop lesson, where you can set up and learn how to use Unix Shell commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Note to Windows Users: Install Git Bash\n",
    "As noted in the free Shell Workshop linked above, we recommend you install Git Bash here and use this as your terminal for this lesson. Please note that during installation you should select the checkbox Use Git and Optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt. This will allow you to use Unix commands while in Windows. If you'd rather use PowerShell, those commands are also provided in this lesson. For more information on the different command shells, check out the Shell Workshop lesson linked above.\n",

    "2. Is Python Already Installed On Your Computer?\n",
    "In this course, we're using the most recent major version of Python - Python 3. Although Python 2 is still being used in many places, it is no longer being updated. In order to keep up compatibility with future improvements to Python, we recommend using Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mac OS X and Linux usually come with Python 2 already installed. We DO NOT recommend that you make any changes to this Python, since parts of the operating system are using Python. However, it shouldn't do any harm to your system to install Python 3 separately, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows doesn't usually come with Python included, but you can still check whether you have it installed before going ahead. So, first, check that youâ€™ve not already got Python 3 installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up your Terminal or Command Line (this would be Git Bash on Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a new terminal or command prompt, type\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "$ python --version\n",
    "and press Enter.\n",
    "```\n",
    "You might get a response that the Python version installed is something like Python 2.7.9. In that case, it would tell you that you have Python 2 installed, and you'll want to follow the steps in the next couple of sections to update it to Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead the version number starts with a 3, then you already have Python 3 installed! Don't install Python again!\n",
    "\n",
    "So test your command line but chances are if you're running this notebook you can run these commands below and determine what versions you are running."

    "## Third-Party Libraries\n",
    "There are tens of thousands of third-party libraries written by independent developers! You can install them using pip, a package manager that is included with Python 3. pip is the standard package manager for Python, but it isn't the only one. One popular alternative is Anaconda which is designed specifically for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a package using pip, just enter \"pip install\" followed by the name of the package in your command line like this: pip install package_name. This downloads and installs the package so that it's available to import in your programs. Once installed, you can import third-party packages using the same syntax used to import from the standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a requirements.txt File\n",
    "Larger Python programs might depend on dozens of third party packages. To make it easier to share these programs, programmers often list a project's dependencies in a file called requirements.txt. This is an example of a requirements.txt file.\n",
    "```json\n",
    "beautifulsoup4==4.5.1\n",
    "bs4==0.0.1\n",
    "pytz==2016.7\n",
    "requests==2.11.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of the file includes the name of a package and its version number. The version number is optional, but it usually should be included. Libraries can change subtly, or dramatically, between versions, so it's important to use the same library versions that the program's author used when they wrote the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use pip to install all of a project's dependencies at once by typing pip install -r requirements.txt in your command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Third-Party Packages\n",
    "Being able to install and import third party libraries is useful, but to be an effective programmer you also need to know what libraries are available for you to use. People typically learn about useful new libraries from online recommendations or from colleagues. If you're a new Python programmer you may not have many colleagues, so to get you started here's a list of packages that are popular with engineers at Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [IPython](https://ipython.org/) - A better interactive Python interpreter\n",
    "- [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/) - As of IPython 4.0, the language-agnostic parts of the project: the notebook format, message protocol, qtconsole, notebook web application, etc. have moved to new projects under the name Jupyter.\n",

    "## Python Resources\n",
    "While there are many online resources about programming, not all of the them are created equal. This list of resources is in approximate order of reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) - This section of the official documentation surveys Python's syntax and standard library. It uses examples, and is written using less technical language than the main documentation. Make sure you're reading the Python 3 version of the docs!\n",
    "2. [The Python Language and Library References](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) - The Language Reference and Library Reference are more technical than the tutorial, but they are the definitive sources of truth. As you become increasingly acquainted with Python you should use these resources more and more.\n",
    "3. [Third-Party Library Documentation](https://readthedocs.org/) - Third-party libraries publish their documentation on their own websites, and often times at https://readthedocs.org/. You can judge the quality of a third-party library by the quality of its documentation. If the developers haven't found time to write good docs, they probably haven't found the time to polish their library either.\n",
    "4. The websites and blogs of prominent experts - The previous resources are primary sources, meaning that they are documentation from the same people who wrote the code being documented. Primary sources are the most reliable. Secondary sources are also extremely valuable. The difficulty with secondary sources is determining the credibility of the source. The websites of authors like [Doug Hellmann](https://doughellmann.com/blog/) and developers like [Eli Bendersky](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/) are excellent. The blog of an unknown author might be excellent, or it might be rubbish.\n",
    "5. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This question and answer site has a good amount of traffic, so it's likely that someone has asked (and someone has answered) a related question before! However, answers are provided by volunteers and vary in quality. Always understand solutions before putting them into your program. One line answers without any explanation are dubious. This is a good place to find out more about your question or discover alternative search terms.\n",
    "6. Bug Trackers - Sometimes you'll encounter a problem so rare, or so new, that no one has addressed it on StackOverflow. You might find a reference to your error in a bug report on GitHub for instance. These bug reports can be helpful, but you'll probably have to do some original engineering work to solve the problem.\n",
    "7. Random Web Forums - Sometimes your search yields references to forums that haven't been active since 2004, or some similarly ancient time. If these are the only resources that address your problem, you should rethink how you're approaching your solution."
